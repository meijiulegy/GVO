        <p>Welcome to online visual field test.</p>
        <p>This tool is intended for research and education. </p>
        <p>The purpose of this research is to find out which distance calibration method is better in an online visual field test in terms of accuracy and ease of use.</p>
        <p>This is not a medical exam. It is not intended for use in the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of diseases.</p>
        <p>Please start with the questionnaire below.</p>
        <p></p><br>

        <H3>Questionnaire</H3>
        <p>In order to acquire valid data for analysis, eyes with increased risk of visual field defects are excluded.</p>

        <p>1. Are you currently under the care of an ophthalmologist?</p>

        <H3>Instructions:</H3>
        <p>Do not return to previous pages during the test.</p>
        <p>Do not resize the windows.</p>
        <p>Each visual field test takes less than 1 minute. You may take a break between tests. The entire process should take 10-15 minutes without breaks.</p>
        <p>You will start with a practice round of visual field test, followed by four rounds of distance calibration, each followed by an additional round of visual field test. </p>
        <p>For the distance calibrations, you will need: a standard sized ID/bank card, an A4 sized paper/notebook, and a rope to measure distance with.</p>

        <p>During a visual field test:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Put on your corrective lenses or reading glasses.</li>
            <li>Keep your head still.</li>
            <li>Cover the eye that is not being tested (do not simply "close" the eye, see figure below), fixate the other eye on the yellow target at the center of the screen at all times.</li>
            <li>Press spacebar everytime you see a stimulus (black dots).</li>
            <div>
                <img src = "coverEye.png">
            </div>
        </ul>
        <p>A 'Show results' button will be displayed after each visual field test. Click on this button to see the results and to proceed to next step. </p>
        <p>After the later rounds of test, you will also be asked to assign a score to the distance calibration method based on ease of use.</p><br>

        <p>Choose below which eye you wish to test. The same eye will be tested for all parts of this study.</p>
        <p>When ready, <strong>tick the "ready" checkbox and then press spacebar</strong> to begin the practice round. The first stimulus will appear after a short delay. Press spacebar everytime you see a stimulus</p>

        <p>Choose which eye to test:</p>
        <input type="radio" name="testEye" id="leftEye" value="-1">
        <label for="leftEye">Left eye</label>
